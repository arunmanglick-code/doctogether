What Are Alexa Skills?
Skills are like apps for Alexa, and provide a new channel for your content and services. 
Skills let customers use their voices to perform everyday tasks like checking the news, listening to music, playing a game, and more. 
Organizations and individuals can publish skills in the Alexa Skills Store to reach and delight customers on hundreds of millions of Alexa devices.

The Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) provides self-service APIs and tools that you can use to build Alexa skills. 
You can also hire an agency with Alexa expertise to help your organization build a skill.
